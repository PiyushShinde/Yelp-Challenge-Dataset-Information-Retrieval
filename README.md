# Yelp-Challenge-Dataset-Information-Retrieval

The Yelp Challenge Dataset was available at https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

We filtered the restaurant-based businesses for three major cities - Charlotte, Scottsdale and Pittsburgh and built a recommendation system based on user reviews. We employed techniques like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Document to Vector (Doc2Vec) and Word2Vec with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to create Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Recommendation Systems.
